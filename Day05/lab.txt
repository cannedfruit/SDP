1.  a) The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate them and makes them interchangeable
    within that family. It uses an interface to define a method that all subclasses will use.
    The subclasses define their own version of the method and any classes that want to call on that method
    will keep a field to contain one of the subclasses to define which method they are choosing.

    b) It is appropriate to use the Strategy Design Pattern when we want to define a class
     that will have one behaviours that is similar to other behaviours in a list.
     It also reduces a long list of conditionals and avoids duplicate code.
     Class changes do not force other class changes and can hide complicated code from the user.
     However, the design pattern increases the number of classes and objects necessary.

3. The Abstract Factory Pattern is appropriate when we want to separate the details of implementation
  from their general usage. In other words, it allows you to create families of related objects without
  specifying a concrete class and allows you to use objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime.
